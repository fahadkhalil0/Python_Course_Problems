# sets in python
# collection of well defined items...means non repititive items

#Set appears as a dictionary
SET = {} # this will become a dictionary not a set.
t1 = type(SET)
print(t1)

#Actual Set
set1 = set() #this will become a set.

#dictionary bcz key:value pairing
Diff = {1:100, 2:200, 3:300, 4:400}
print(Diff, type(Diff))


#This Difference between dictionary and the set is that Dictionary comes with key:value pairing and set is non-repititive elements.
